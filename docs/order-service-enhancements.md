# OrderService Implementation Enhancements

## Overview
The `OrderServiceImpl` class has been enhanced with robust order management capabilities including status transitions, order cancellation, and inventory restoration. This document outlines the implemented features and their functionality.

## Enhanced Features

### 1. Status Transition Management

#### validateStatusTransition()
- **Purpose**: Validates that order status transitions follow business rules
- **Business Rules**:
  - PENDING → CONFIRMED, CANCELLED
  - CONFIRMED → PROCESSING, CANCELLED
  - PROCESSING → SHIPPED, CANCELLED
  - SHIPPED → DELIVERED
  - DELIVERED → (no transitions allowed)
  - CANCELLED → (no transitions allowed)

#### getStatusName()
- **Purpose**: Maps status IDs to human-readable names
- **Mappings**:
  - PENDING → "Pending"
  - CONFIRMED → "Confirmed"
  - PROCESSING → "Processing"
  - SHIPPED → "Shipped"
  - DELIVERED → "Delivered"
  - CANCELLED → "Cancelled"

#### updateOrderDatesForStatus()
- **Purpose**: Automatically updates relevant dates when status changes
- **Behavior**:
  - SHIPPED → Sets `shippedDate` if not already set
  - DELIVERED → Sets `deliveredDate` if not already set

### 2. Enhanced updateOrderStatus()

The `updateOrderStatus()` method now includes:
- **Status Transition Validation**: Prevents invalid status changes
- **Automatic Status Name Setting**: Sets human-readable status names
- **Date Updates**: Automatically updates relevant dates based on status

### 3. Order Cancellation with Inventory Restoration

#### cancelOrder()
Enhanced to provide comprehensive order cancellation:
- **Validation**: Prevents cancellation of shipped/delivered orders
- **Inventory Restoration**: Automatically restores stock for cancelled items
- **Notes Updates**: Appends cancellation reason to order notes
- **Error Handling**: Gracefully handles inventory restoration failures

#### validateOrderCancellation()
- **Purpose**: Validates that an order can be cancelled
- **Rules**:
  - Cannot cancel SHIPPED or DELIVERED orders
  - Cannot cancel already CANCELLED orders
  - Cannot cancel orders with a shipping date

#### restoreInventoryForCancelledOrder()
- **Purpose**: Restores inventory for all items in a cancelled order
- **Process**:
  1. Retrieves all order items
  2. Creates inventory adjustments with type `INCREASE`
  3. Records adjustments through `InventoryService`
  4. Logs success/failure for each item
- **Error Handling**: Individual item failures don't prevent order cancellation

### 4. Date Management Enhancement

#### markOrderShipped()
- Sets the shipped date
- Updates status to SHIPPED
- Persists changes

#### markOrderDelivered()
- Sets the delivered date  
- Updates status to DELIVERED
- Persists changes

## Implementation Details

### Status Transition Flow
```
PENDING → CONFIRMED → PROCESSING → SHIPPED → DELIVERED
    ↓         ↓           ↓
 CANCELLED  CANCELLED  CANCELLED
```

### Inventory Restoration Process
1. **Validation**: Check if order can be cancelled
2. **Item Processing**: For each order item:
   - Create `InventoryAdjustmentDto` with type `INCREASE`
   - Record adjustment through `InventoryService`
   - Log result (success/warning)
3. **Status Update**: Set order status to CANCELLED
4. **Notes Update**: Append cancellation reason

### Error Handling Strategy
- **Inventory Failures**: Log warnings but continue with cancellation
- **Invalid Transitions**: Throw `IllegalArgumentException`
- **Invalid Cancellations**: Throw `IllegalStateException`

## Testing

Comprehensive unit tests have been implemented covering:
- ✅ Valid status transitions
- ✅ Invalid status transition rejection
- ✅ Automatic date updates on status changes
- ✅ Successful order cancellation with inventory restoration
- ✅ Prevention of invalid order cancellations
- ✅ Graceful handling of inventory restoration failures
- ✅ Order shipping and delivery date setting
- ✅ Status counting functionality
- ✅ Status name mapping

## Usage Examples

### Updating Order Status
```java
// Valid transition
orderService.updateOrderStatus(storeId, orderId, "CONFIRMED");

// This would throw IllegalArgumentException
orderService.updateOrderStatus(storeId, orderId, "DELIVERED"); // Invalid from PENDING
```

### Cancelling an Order
```java
// Successful cancellation with inventory restoration
Optional<OrderDto> result = orderService.cancelOrder(storeId, orderId, "Customer requested");

// This would throw IllegalStateException  
orderService.cancelOrder(storeId, shippedOrderId, "Too late"); // Order already shipped
```

### Marking Orders Shipped/Delivered
```java
// Mark as shipped with timestamp
orderService.markOrderShipped(storeId, orderId, Instant.now());

// Mark as delivered
orderService.markOrderDelivered(storeId, orderId, Instant.now());
```

## Benefits

1. **Data Integrity**: Prevents invalid status transitions
2. **Business Logic Enforcement**: Follows proper order lifecycle
3. **Inventory Management**: Automatic stock restoration on cancellation  
4. **Audit Trail**: Comprehensive logging and notes updates
5. **Error Resilience**: Graceful error handling for external service failures
6. **Maintainability**: Well-tested, documented code with clear separation of concerns

## Future Enhancements

Potential areas for future improvement:
- Configurable status transition rules
- Partial cancellation support
- Integration with notification services
- Enhanced inventory reservation handling
- Support for order modification workflows
